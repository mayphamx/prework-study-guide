        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web such as text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements. Some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page are meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements. HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. The head element is not visible to the users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. The body element is visible to users.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>The margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
         <li>The padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
         <li>astrik(*) applies styling properties to all the elements visible on the page</li>
         <li>commas(,) combine two selectors into a single CSS rule allowing  the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
         <li>img -  assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
         <li>block -  assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
         <li>link - link element creates the connection to the external file </li>
         <li>rel - specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
         <li>href - specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>EX. <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" (links css to html in the header between the meta name and title)></li>
          <li>card. - class selector that styles different topics that contains width, margin, border, and box-shadow properties; the period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>
          <li>width: 80%:;  - width of the element at 80% of the available width</li>
          <li>margin: 40px auto; -  margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right</li>
          <li>border: 5px solid gray; -  border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray</li>
          <li>box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888; - box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box)</li>
          <li>section class="card" - class selector that can be assigned to all section elements in the html file that will assign the same property assignments to all sections</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more. In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
          <li>touch script.js - (in gitbash) creates a new javascript file to a repo</li>
